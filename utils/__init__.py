# NOTE: The `.visualization` module is not imported here, as it may be referencing `pxr` or other vendor modules, which
# may not have been installed through PIP yet when performing environment checks for the Jupyter Notebook. This module 
# is instead intended to be imported directly through `from utils.visualization import DisplayUSD` in order for `pxr` 
# modules not to "leak" in the Python runtime.
